This lab demonstrates building web interfaces using three distinct tools 
## —Bootstrap 5.3, Tailwind CSS, and React.js
**—highlighting the differences between component-based and utility-first frameworks, as well as showcasing React’s declarative approach with Hooks.**

## Tools Used
 --**Bootstrap 5.3** – A component‑based CSS framework used for rapid, responsive layouts and ready‑made UI components (navbar, grid system, buttons, alerts) via CDN Bootstrap

--**Tailwind CSS**– A utility‑first CSS framework enabling low‑level utility classes (e.g. bg-blue-500, rounded, text-white, md:grid-cols-2) directly in markup for custom, responsive designs without writing new CSS Tailwind CSS
.

--**React.js** – A declarative JavaScript library using components, props, and the useState Hook to manage state and interactivity in function components React
.

## Experience
-Working with Bootstrap reinforced how quickly you can scaffold a polished layout without writing custom CSS, leveraging a mature grid and component library
-Tailwind’s utility‑first approach felt more flexible; by composing small utility classes, we crafted bespoke responsive cards with ease, illustrating the power of design tokens over traditional CSS files
-In React, building a simple prop‑driven component and toggling internal state with useState underscored the benefits of a declarative, component‑based architecture for UI logic separation and reusability.

## Completed Features
**Bootstrap Demo**
-Responsive navbar, Two‑column grid layout & Styled button and alert components
